    "## Summary of Route Simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "At **200 points**, the simplified route retains a high level of detail, closely following the original path. Most minor turns and curves are still visible, offering a good representation of the original route while reducing the data size by almost 90% (from 1757 to 200 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of points decreases to **100 and 50**, the route still preserves the overall shape and major turns. However, finer details and smaller deviations from a straight line start to disappear. The general direction and significant landmarks along the route remain identifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "At **30 and 20 points**, the simplification becomes more aggressive. The route begins to appear noticeably smoother, and only the most prominent bends and directional changes are kept. Areas with gentle curves might be approximated by straight lines, and some characteristic features of the original path may be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **10 and 5 points**, the route is highly generalized. It effectively captures only the start, end, and a few critical turning points, essentially outlining the general trajectory rather than the detailed path. Significant portions of the original route are replaced by long, straight segments. At 5 points (actual 4), the route is reduced to its bare minimum, providing only a very coarse overview of the journey's extent and primary direction. This level of simplification is useful for high-level overviews or when storage/processing is severely constrained, but it sacrifices almost all fine-grained geographical context."

    "### Q&A\n",
    "Based on the generated plots and their analysis:\n",
    "*   **At 200 points,** the simplified route maintains a high level of detail, closely mirroring the original path. Most minor turns and curves are still visible, reducing data size by approximately 89% (from 1757 to 200 points) while retaining a good representation.\n",
    "*   **At 100 and 50 points,** the overall shape and major turns are preserved, but finer details and smaller deviations begin to disappear. Key directional changes remain identifiable.\n",
    "*   **At 30 and 20 points,** simplification becomes more pronounced. The route appears smoother, retaining only the most prominent bends. Gentle curves may be approximated by straight lines, and some characteristic features of the original path are lost.\n",
    "*   **At 10 and 5 points,** the route is highly generalized, capturing primarily the start, end, and a few critical turning points. Significant portions are replaced by long, straight segments. At 5 points (actual 4), it provides a very coarse overview of the journey's extent and primary direction, sacrificing almost all fine-grained geographical context for extreme data reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
    "*   The initial GPX file contained 1757 track points.\n",
    "*   The Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm was successfully implemented to simplify the route.\n",
    "*   A custom function was developed to find the optimal epsilon value for RDP, allowing for simplification to target point counts of 200, 100, 50, 30, 20, 10, and 5. The function achieved point counts very close to the targets (e.g., 200 points for a target of 200, 101 for 100, and 4 for 5).\n",
    "*   Each simplified route was successfully visualized on a separate map using an OpenStreetMap (OSM) background via `contextily`, with all x and y axis labels removed as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "*   The choice of simplification level is a critical trade-off between data size/processing efficiency and the preservation of geographical detail. Applications requiring high precision (e.g., detailed navigation) would opt for higher point counts (e.g., 200 points), while those needing high-level overviews or facing severe resource constraints could use highly simplified routes (e.g., 5-10 points).\n",
    "*   Further analysis could involve quantifying the \"loss of detail\" at each simplification level using metrics like area difference between the original and simplified route polygons, or evaluating how specific geographical features are affected, to better inform the choice of optimal epsilon for different use cases.\n"
