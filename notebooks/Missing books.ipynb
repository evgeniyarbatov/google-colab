    "The Cain Series Box Set,['Mike Ryan'],2019-10-01,\"Follow along with Matthew Cain on his journey from a fallen Delta Force soldier into a super-assassin for an ultra secret government agency. The following four books are included in this bundle: The Cain Conspiracy Shot in the head and recovering from brain surgery, Delta Force soldier Thomas Nelson wakes up in a military hospital unable to remember who he is. Faced with going through recovery alone, with no family that he's aware of, he is recruited by a top secret government agency. Project Specter is tasked with eliminating targets they deem to be a threat to the United States. Their goal is to turn Nelson into a super assassin named Matthew Cain. Cain's first mission is supposed to be a piece of cake. Just take out an escaped fugitive in Honduras who's on the run for the rape and murder of a little girl in New York. There's only one problem...somebody beat him to it. Everything is not what it seems as Cain gets mixed up with an international arms dealer and an ex government agent who's gone rogue and supposed to be dead. The Cain Deception ​In this follow-up to The Cain Conspiracy, Matthew Cain finds himself on the wrong side of a hit man. After he is sent on an assassination mission in Russia, The Specter Project learns of a man seeking revenge for Cain's actions. After Cain hears of the man's intentions, he sets out on a frenetic search to find the killer before he makes good on his plans to kill both Cain and his girlfriend. Along the way, Cain finds more questions than answers about the mysterious assassin, who seems to be a ghost. As Cain dives deeper into his quest, he starts to wonder about his role within the super secret agency and whether there are those above him who know more than what they appear. The Cain Directive Cain, still reeling from the attack on his girlfriend, gets even more suspicious of Project Specter when they send him to Russia to find Dmitri Kurylenko, a man he has already secretly killed. After another attempt on his life, he soon learns of the agency's involvement in keeping his memory from him and sets to meet with a man who seems to know everything. Unfortunately for Cain, Specter showed up first and framed Cain for murder. Now, on the run, he must protect those close to him, while also trying to prove his innocence. In his quest to take down Project Specter, Cain turns to the only man he can trust for help, Eric Raines, a man Specter wants almost as badly as Cain, and a man as equally bent on taking down Specter as he is. The Cain Redemption ​Cain finally relents to getting his head and seizures fixed, but his recovery time is cut short from eight weeks to one week when he learns his fellow agent, and friend, Eric Raines has gone missing. Will the rushed recovery period have dire consequences for the super assassin? Despite the concerns of those closest to him, Cain ignores the personal dangers to his health in his quest to find his friend and the last remaining remnants of the previous Specter regime, who are still on the run. His adventures take him to France, Germany, and back to Honduras, where it all started for him. Will his mission end where it all began?\",nok\n",

    "Nine Days in Hell,['Jeff Wells'],2019-09-10,\"A teenager during the Battle of Britain, Rod enlisted in the British Army at age seventeen, prepared to fight as an Infantryman in World War II. Following a successful Normandy invasion, Rod planned to join the Allies' rapid advance across Europe. Just weeks into Basic Training, Rod was selected for Commando School, destined to join an elite group of special operations war fighters. Weeks before Rod was due to graduate Commando training, he was mysteriously removed and transported to an airfield. The next day, he participated in the largest Airborne invasion in military history. On September 17, 1944, Rod jumped into Arnhem as part of 'Operation Market Garden, ' an aggressive plan to secure an attack route into Germany through the Netherlands. Despite being wounded as he exited the aircraft, Rod fought in Arnhem for nine days in brutal, unthinkable conditions. Surrounded by Germans, 10,000 of Rod's men jumped in, and only 2,000 returned. Demonstrating remarkable courage, led by Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, Rod and his men held the Arnhem Bridge for three days, repelling massive German counterattacks. Finally running out of food, supplies, and ammunition, Frost was wounded, leaving Rod and his men to fend for themselves. For the next six days, Rod fought through brutal urban combat in Arnhem.One of few Arnhem survivors, Rod continued military service through the end of war, to Russia, the Nuremburg Trials, and even the liberation of a German Concentration Camp. Following the war, Rod worked on several top-secret government projects including a real-life flying saucer, as well as the Avro Arrow, one of the most controversial military projects in history. Later, Rod was recruited by General Motors where he developed prototypes for the Corvette project. A very quiet and humble man, Rod has never shared his story. Spanning from childhood to today, with a focus on his World War II service, this is Rod's story. Written by a soldier, for a soldier, author Jeff Wells frames Rod's military experiences within the strategic significance of Operation Market Garden. Incorporating the work of other historians and his own experiences in combat, Wells frames Rod's role within the greater context of World War II. 100% of all proceeds from the sale of this book assist WISH for OUR HEROES, a charity dedicated to helping military families with basic needs: food, shelter, transportation, child needs, and medical expenses.

We know this is true because Jesus, the Pattern Son, has already entered into this realm as our Forerunner, and where Jesus goes, His Sons will follow. In six concise and compelling chapters, the author presents a stunning picture of a \"\\\"ministry without limitation\"\\\" that will be entered into by fully mature Sons of God. This soon-to-be-revealed ministry will operate in a new dimension beyond justification and Holy Spirit baptism, the first two crucial steps; a realm of life and restoration, for which all creation yearns.

But each of them contains an element of truth - a real event or a West Country legend. After you've acquainted yourself with the ghosts, the myths and the conspiracies of silence, your dilemma will be to choose which elements may constitute a germ of reality, and which may be a tall tale. Robert did once live in the house in Windsor Terrace which features in 'Clara's Secret'. And his father did have a long after-dinner story about being sent in search of a Bristol Blue glass vase when he was applying for a job, as mirrored in 'The Bristol Blue Vase'. Then again, Robert did once capture a spectral figure in a photograph he took at a wedding, just like Daniel did in 'In the Blink of an Eye'. There are also surviving members of the Bristol Home Guard who have always wondered why they were detailed to guard the Clifton Observatory, the story of 'From Reel to Real'\"\\\".

    "Lonely Boy,['Steve Jones'],2017-01-10,\"Without the Sex Pistols there would be no punk. And without Steve Jones there would be no Sex Pistols. It was Steve who, with his schoolmate Paul Cook, formed the band that eventually went on to become the Sex Pistols and who was its original leader. As the world celebrates the 40th anniversary of punk -- the influence and cultural significance of which is felt in music, fashion, and the visual arts to this day--Steve tells his story for the very first time. Steve Jones's modern Dickensian tale began in the street of Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush, West London, where as a lonely, neglected boy living off his wits and petty thievery he was given purpose by the glam art rock of David Bowie and Roxy Music. He became one of the first generation of ragamuffin punks taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood. In Lonely Boy, Steve describes the sadness of never having known his real dad, the abuse he suffered at the hands of his stepfather, and how his interest in music and fashion saved him from a potential life of crime spent in remand centers and prisons. He takes readers on his journey from the Kings Road of the early '70s through the years of the Sex Pistols, punk rock, and the recording of \"\\\"Anarchy in the UK\"\\\" and Never Mind the Bollocks. He recounts his infamous confrontation on Bill Grundy's Today program -- the interview that ushered in the \"\\\"Filth and the Fury\"\\\" headlines that catapulted punk into the national consciousness. And he delves into the details of his self-imposed exile in New York and Los Angeles, where he battled alcohol, heroin, and sex addiction but eventually emerged to gain fresh acclaim as an actor and radio host. Lonely Boy is the story of an unlikely guitar hero who, with the Sex Pistols, transformed twentieth-century culture and kick-started a social revolution.\",nok\n",

    "Let Your Mind Run,\"['Deena Kastor', 'Michelle Hamilton']\",2018-04-10,\"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Deena Kastor was a star youth runner with tremendous promise, yet her career almost ended after college, when her competitive method—run as hard as possible, for fear of losing—fostered a frustration and negativity and brought her to the brink of burnout. On the verge of quitting, she took a chance and moved to the high altitudes of Alamosa, Colorado, where legendary coach Joe Vigil had started the first professional distance-running team. There she encountered the idea that would transform her running career: the notion that changing her thinking—shaping her mind to be more encouraging, kind, and resilient—could make her faster than she’d ever imagined possible. Building a mind so strong would take years of effort and discipline, but it would propel Kastor to the pinnacle of running—to American records in every distance from the 5K to the marathon—and to the accomplishment of earning America’s first Olympic medal in the marathon in twenty years. Let Your Mind Run is a fascinating intimate look inside the mind of an elite athlete, a remarkable story of achievement, and an insightful primer on how the small steps of cultivating positivity can give anyone a competitive edge.\",ok\n",

    "Essays in International Trade,['Xue Bai'],2014,\"Chapter 1: Self-inflicted Wounds? China's Restrictions on Direct Trading (with Kala Krishna)In this paper we discuss the background of China's restrictive policy on direct trading rights and document the changes made in the requirements for domestically-owned Chinese firms to have direct trading rights. We first show that these restrictions (and hence their removal) had differential coverage across industry, location and time. By looking at the impact of removing these restrictions on a variety of variables, we argue that removal of this restrictive policy was indeed an important force affecting exports. Exploiting information on eligibility for direct trading rights at the firm-level, we evaluate the effect of becoming eligible for direct trading on firm behavior and performance. We find positive and significant effects of gaining eligibility on probability of exporting, export values and total revenue. Moreover, most of the effects come from former indirect exporters. This suggests that former indirect exporters who may have been the most constrained firms who gained the most from the liberalization. We also find that gaining direct trading rights tomorrow has advance effect on firms' probability of exporting today suggesting firms are more likely to export indirectly in anticipation of becoming eligible tomorrow. However, these exports are small so that becoming eligible today raises export value and revenues tomorrow, not yesterday so that eligibility operates on these variable with a lag. Chapter 2: How You Export Matters: Export Mode, Learning, and Productivity in China (with Kala Krishna and Hong Ma)Firms can choose how they export: directly or through intermediaries. What are the costs and benefits of such choices? Firms may choose to trade directly, even if this is more costly in the short run, if doing so results in better future outcomes. A policy pursued by China gives us a unique chance to look at such trade-offs in the real world. Before China's accession to the WTO, a large share of domestic Chinese firms were not allowed to export directly, only through intermediaries. In this paper we develop and estimate a dynamic discrete choice model where firms choose their export mode. We recover not only the sunk and fixed costs of exporting according to mode, but also the evolution of productivity and demand under different export modes. We find that the evolution of both demand and productivity is more favorable under direct exporting. On average, starting direct exporting requires significantly higher start-up costs than starting indirect exporting. It is also more costly to remain a direct exporter than to remain an indirect one. Moreover, climbing the export ladder by starting off as an indirect exporter and then transitioning into direct exporting is cheaper than exporting directly to begin with. Our counterfactual experiment suggests that this policy reduced Chinese export growth considerably. Exports would have been $30$ percent less and the export participation rate would have been $37$ percent lower had there been no liberalization of trading rights. In addition, we compare the effects of different trade policies, namely export subsidies and subsidies on export costs. For export subsidies, it is better to target direct exporters over indirect ones, both for increasing the number of exporters and in terms of exports per dollar expended. However for cost subsidies, the opposite is true.Chapter 3: Productivity and Exporting: Selection, Learning by Exporting and Preparing to Export (with Bernardo Diaz de Astarloa and Kala Krishna)Much of the trade literature has focused on the links between productivity and exporting. Three channels have been emphasized. First, productivity causes exporting, so that there is selection into exporting by more productive firms. Second, that exporting generates productivity growth through, for example, learning-by-exporting. Third, that firms make choices that make them more productive in preparation to export. In this paper, we study these links and try to entangle this export-productivity correlation. Utilizing unique features of the Chinese data, we focus on the entire evolution of firms' productivity and decompose productivity growth before and after entering foreign markets. We show that patterns of Chinese exporters are consistent with all three hypotheses. First, exporters are more productive than non-exporters, which is consistent with selection. Future exporters' productivity grow steadily both before and after entry. A larger share of this growth of successful exporters happened after the entry, while productivity growth slows down after exiting for unsuccessful exporters. This is consistent with the learning-by-exporting theory and suggest possible active preparation to export. Furthermore, new exporters increase sales expenditures and earn higher revenue from new products than other firms before they start exporting. This indicates that firms actively invest in marketing structures and product upgrading to prepare for exporting in both demand and cost sides. This is true when compared to both non-exporters and continuous exporters. In addition, China's gradual and anticipated liberalization of direct trading rights help us identify further firm actions in preparing to export. In particular, we find evidence showing that Chinese firms undertook investment with the specific purpose of acquiring direct trading rights.\",nok\n",

    "High Speed Passive Radar Receiver with Application to Digital Television Signals,['Weiwei Sun'],2017,\"In this dissertation we present initial results from the fourth generation receiver for the Manastash Ridge Radar (MRR), which is a distributed passive radar system used for ionospheric physics and engineering studies. This receiver permits simultaneous access to the HF, VHF, and UHF spectrum by sampling at speeds up to 5 billion samples per second on each antennas. This system has large aggregate bandwidth; it can simultaneously collect the entire VHF FM broadcast band as well as several UHF DTV broadcasts. The digitizers have eight-bit precision. The wide bandwidth sampling (oversampling) means that it is possible to accurately sample narrowband signals whose amplitude is much less than the least sampling quantum. Most of the analog signal path is eliminated, yielding excellent dynamic range, and high speed digital signal processing yields low-latency real time operation. We also present initial data from such a receiver used to support passive bistatic radar experiments. We discuss in detail algorithms to make effective use of the FPGA. For example, the sampler runs 8 or 16 times faster than the FPGA, so initial FPGA processing requires parallel algorithms. In our design the downconverter passband center frequencies and spectral widths are selectable at run time, and can be changed in a few milliseconds. The FPGA operates in fixed point, which presents both opportunities and challenges in managing precision during the signal processing, for networking, and for subsequent signal processing. Data is sent off the receiver via one or more 10 GbE ports. In our current implementation system performance is limited primarily by network bandwidth. For radar application, the signal to clutter ratio is dominant for radar system performance. DTV signals have a known structure which permits recovery of the original transmitted waveform from imperfect reception. With such a nearly ideal reference signal, we are able to map the multipath and also improve the instantaneous dynamic range to over 100 dB with one-second coherent processing, and thus detect the weak echoes from targets of interest, such as aircraft or ionospheric field-aligned irregularities, and pave the way for AoA estimates or interferometric imaging of these scatterers.\",nok\n",
    "Predictors of Adolescent Boys Seeking Help from Their Father and Their Mother,['Brett Robinson'],2015,\"Previous research has shown that adolescent boys hold less positive views of help seeking and seek help less frequently than adolescent girls (Garland & Zigler, 1994; Raviv et al., 2009; Sears, 2004). However, few studies have focused solely on adolescent boys in order to understand their help-seeking experiences. In addition, few studies have distinguished between adolescents’ experiences seeking help from their father and from their mother. Guided by Newman’s model of adaptive help seeking (1991, 2000), we examined the frequency with which adolescent boys sought help from their father and their mother; identified markers of social-cognitive skills, affective-motivational resources, and an environmental factor (i.e., parent coaching of help seeking) that predicted boys’ help seeking from their father and their mother; and examined whether an environmental factor moderated the relationships between boys’ reports of their relationship quality with a parent and help-seeking behaviour from a parent. Two hundred and thirty-two adolescent boys enrolled in a New Brunswick high school (Grades 9-11) completed an anonymous survey at school. Results indicated that boys “sometimes” sought help from their father and their mother. Boys’ reports of more self-disclosure to their father and more positive past help-seeking experiences with their father predicted more frequent help seeking from their father. Boys’ reports of more self-disclosure to their mother, more positive past help-seeking experiences with their mother, and more coaching by their mother to use help-seeking behaviour predicted more frequent help seeking from their mother. In addition, boys’ reports of mother coaching use of help seeking moderated the relationship between boys’ reports of negative relationship qualities with their father and help seeking from their father. Supplemental analyses revealed that boys’ emotional competence and reports of positive qualities in the parent-adolescent relationship were also important correlates of boys’ help-seeking behaviour from their father and their mother. These findings provide support for applying Newman’s model to the family context. Other implications for Newman’s model and alternative models of help seeking, as well as for prevention and intervention strategies targeting boys’ use of help seeking from their father and their mother are also discussed.\",nok\n",

    "Numerical Studies of Turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard Magnetoconvection in Rectangular Enclosures,['Wenjun Liu'],2019,\"Turbulente Magnetokonvektion in Flüssigmetallen wird in geschlossenen rechteckigen Zellen für starke äußere Magnetfelder durch direkte numerische Simulationen untersucht, welche die quasistatische Näherung anwenden. Das Hauptziel ist es, zu verstehen wie der turbulenten Wärme und Impulstransport beeinflusst wird und wie die Konvektionsstrukturen durch die Magnetfelder umorganisiert werden. In dieser Arbeit werden zwei Systeme untersucht, bei denen die turbulente RB-Konvektion in einem horizontalen Magnetfeld bzw. einem vertikalen Magnetfeld erfolgt. Für das System mit einem horizontalen Magnetfeld wird RB-Konvektion bei einer Rayleigh-Zahl von 1e6 in einer Zelle mit quadratischer Grundfläche und einer langen rechteckigen Zelle untersucht. Unterschiedliche Konvektionsregimes werden identifiziert, welche vom Aspektverhältnis und der Stärke des Magnetfelds abhängen. Das bemerkenswerteste Konvektionsregime, das in der Box mit quadratischer Grundfläche beobachtet wird, ist die Umkehrung der Strömung - ein Reorganisationsprozess der rollenartigen Struktur, die durch ein gemäßigtes Magnetfeld eingeschränkt wird. Das Regime zeigt eine interessante Ähnlichkeit mit der großskaligen Intermittenz in einer Kanalströmung mit einem moderaten Magnetfeld in Spannweitenrichtung. Das interessanteste Konvektionsregime in der langen rechteckigen Zelle ist die verdrillte Walzenstruktur, die aus zwei Walzen mit halber Behälterlänge mit unterschiedlichen Ausrichtungen während der Übergangsperiode besteht. Für das System mit einem vertikalen Magnetfeld wird hauptsächlich RB-Konvektion bei einer Rayleigh-Zahl von 1e6 in einer geschlossenen kubischen Zelle und bei einer hohen Rayleigh-Zahl von 1e7 in einer Zelle mit quadratischer Grundfläche beschrieben. Durch eine Fourier-Analyse werden Konvektionsstrukturen mit abnehmender charakteristischer horizontaler Wellenlänge gefunden während Ha zunimmt. Der turbulente Wärmetransport verteilt sich zunehmend auf Strömungsstrukturen, die an den Seitenwänden anliegen. Ähnlich wie bei rotierender RB-Konvektion bestehen die Seitenwandmoden für Ha oberhalb der Chandrasekhar-Grenze fort. Es erfolgt, eine detaillierte Analyse der komplexen Zweischicht-Struktur dieser Seitenwandmoden, ihrer Ausdehnung in das Zellinnere und der daraus resultierenden Zusammensetzung der Seitenwandgrenzschicht, deren Skalierung mit der Shercliff-Schichtdicke erfolgen kann.\",nok\n",
    "Discovering a Larger God,['John Andrews'],2021-01-25,\"A FATHER WHO COMES RUNNINGJohn Andrews was the fourth generation in his family to follow Christian Science, the teachings of Mary Baker Eddy. Then he had a crisis of faith that led to his leaving Science and embracing Christ. \"\\\"The God we meet through Jesus, a Father who runs to welcome his wayward children home, won me over from the perfectionism of Mrs. Eddy's impersonal divine Principle,\"\\\" John says. In these collected essays, he lays bare the fallacies of a Scripture-twisting religion that claims we can think our way to health in this life and to heaven in the next. No one can, Andrews argues; we all need a Savior. Lessons from his life in politics, education, media, and ministry come to bear as John debunks today's credulous culture of self-salvation fads and reflects on his journey to the Cross. This is his seventh book.\",nok\n",

    "A Curious Shipwreck,['Steve Spence'],2010,\"These are poems which are ostensibly about pirates yet the subtext has a satirical impulse which is fuelled by surrealism and a delight in upending the apple cart. The author revels in entertaining juxtapositions and in breathless passages of 'stream-of-consciousness' rant, which work wonderfully on the page or performed live. While there are playful references to traditional pirate mythology these poems also talk about the times we live in, from the joint catastrophes of global warming and the credit crunch to popular culture and media trivia. Wordplay is endemic. There's more than a hint of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear in this book, as the shadowy figure of Alice entices the pirates into further adventures, yet the ships run aground or never manage to leave the harbour. Absurdity is the keyword, as a sense of fun runs parallel to a skewed commentary on topical events.\",nok\n",

The Aztecs believed that offerings of human blood and human lives were necessary to the continued running of the universe. Indeed, in Aztec myths the gods themselves make sacrifices of their own blood and even of their entire bodies in order to create a universe humans can live in and, in one story, to create humans themselves; humans therefore must make blood sacrifices in turn to feed the gods and to keep the universe in existence. To the ancient Aztecs, these practices seemed fitting, necessary, and honorable, helping to connect the world of humans to the divine world of the gods, a universe that in Aztec myth took shape in cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth.

    "The Economics of Solar Electricity,['Erin Baker'],2015,\"The benefits and costs of increasing solar electricity generation depend on the scale of the increase and on the time frame over which it occurs. Short-run analyses focus on the cost-effectiveness of incremental increases in solar capacity, holding the rest of the power system fixed. Solar's variability adds value if its power occurs at high-demand times and displaces relatively carbon-intensive generation. Medium-run analyses consider the implications of nonincremental changes in solar capacity. The cost of each installation may fall through experience effects, but the cost of grid integration increases when solar requires ancillary services and fails to displace investment in other types of generation. Long-run analyses consider the role of solar in reaching twenty-first-century carbon targets. Solar's contribution depends on the representation of grid integration costs, on the availability of other low-carbon technologies, and on the potential for technological advances. By surveying analyses for different time horizons, this article begins to connect and integrate a fairly disjointed literature on the economics of solar energy.\",nok\n",

    "An Irish Tale and Other Stories,['Peter Fleming'],2017,\"Winston (\"\\\"\"\\\"Winter\"\\\"\"\\\") Crowley is a young Irishman who grows up in Canada, but feels forever bound by family ties to his native Belfast. At the age of (almost) twenty, this boy in a cultural bubble returns to Northern Ireland at the request of his aloof, judgemental father, in a final effort to make things right between them during the course of an extraordinary odyssey, circling Ireland's wind-swept coastal shores. While father and son get to know each other as adults and equals, Winter learns something of the war-torn history of his homeland, the mysterious split within two branches of the family, and the attitudes of the Irish toward modern warfare generally, in a war-torn world. But conflict isn't always resolved with bullets. His father teaches Winston a great deal more, including some shocking truths about the oft-time brutal relationship between love, lust, religion and politics. The story of Winston's voyage is fleshed out with other memories - his comically traumatic circumcision at the age of eight, his meeting with a famous, drunken poet and his chance encounter with a talking horse. Collectively, this weird gallery of colourful snapshots captures the life and times of Winston Crowley, Polymath in the making, named after \"\\\"\"\\\"a British National hero and an Irish nut,\"\\\"\"\\\" his travels, friends and family, his own ruminations vividly explored.

    "Becoming 'Co-Ed',\"['Ningning Ma', 'Se Yan', 'Yiling Zhao']\",2023,\"The Protestant missionaries started the trend to educate women in the 19th century China, paving Chinese women's way into higher education and professional services. Using various measures of Protestant activities by 1920 and a hand-collected dataset of college students from 1928-1938, we show that the Protestant missions improved gender equality in higher education. By exploring the timing of Protestant activities, we find counties with earlier missionary settlements had higher levels of gender equality. Because early missionary settlements followed closely with the opening of treaty ports, we adopt an IV strategy that exploits the quasi-random variation in counties' distances to treaty ports opened by 1880. Finally, we find that the increase in educational attainment led to a higher number of female doctors and civil servants in the short run and a higher gender ratio in skilled occupations in the long run.\",nok\n",
    "Walking in the Spirit,['Andrea Bowman'],2013-06-30,\"My name is Andrea Bowman. I've lived a life like many others; perhaps, a life similar to yours. In my sane and sober moments, I wanted to change my life but didn't have the strength to do it. I realized I had lost my self respect, forsaken my children, alienated my family, and was slowly killing myself. My life progressed from bad to worse. I looked in the mirror and saw a stranger-one I did not like. Perhaps, you see the same. My main desire in writing my story and my steps of recovery down on paper is the hope that it will lead others to Christ and give God the glory He is due for changing my life. God has restored my self-esteem, my family relationships, my daughters, my health, and given me unconditional love, peace, joy, acceptance, and forgiveness.I am including a brief \"\\\"picture\"\\\" of my past in the hope that some of my readers will recognize themselves and realize that no matter where they are in their life, they still have a choice to change because nothing is impossible for God (Mark 10:27). It all started when I ran away from home at 14 years old. Not wanting to abide by my parents rules, I decided to go out on my own. I hitchhiked to San Francisco where I knew no one. I found myself living on the streets resorting to prostitution and theft to support myself. Within a very short period of time, I became involved in drugs so deeply that without them I became physically sick. I resorted to any means I could to support my habits. Throughout the years I went to several treatment facilities and attended different recovery programs. These only helped for short periods of time before they failed and I returned back to my old habits.I became involved in many unhealthy and violent relationships during my addiction including numerous failed marriages. I subjected my children to severe emotional upheaval which led me to losing my parental rights and my daughters being taken away.In the midst of my fast-lane living, I was exposed to Hepatitis C and HIV along with my drug use. I became very sick and, at one point, several doctors told me I had less than 6 months to live.This only drove me further from my family and deeper into my addiction. I had lost hope in my life and felt that I deserved whatever happened to me. At one point, I was arrested and jailed but the amount of time I spent locked down was not sufficient enough for the fog to lift and my thinking to clear.Once back on the street, I started manufacturing my own drugs. This time out, I was worse off that before - running rampant in vicious circles of addiction until I was finally arrested again in 2005. This time I received a sentence of 8 years. Four years to be served in the Washington Corrections Center for Women and four years of strict parole. During my incarceration, I began to read my Bible and go to church. While attending chapel in the prison, I met a woman named Pastor Jody Pickney who took an interest in my spiritual well being. It was because of her encouragement and the godly example she set for all of the women prisoners in her services that my outlook began to change. I started on a new path to recovery. From the beginning of this journey, I have discovered the love of my life, Jesus Christ, and He has set me free from the bondage of addiction, sin, and death. My inspiration is Jesus, and through His power and the Holy Spirit, this book was made possible. My qualifications for writing this book are based on my life experiences and my faith in Christ to guide my pen. My task is not to convince you of God's grace and wisdom in my own words, but to testify of the truth of the gospel and God's love for each of us individually.In our own way, we are all prisoners to something or someone. Why not be set free by Christ Jesus? I hope this book will bless you, inspire you, and influence your heart, mind, and soul. Change is possible-I am living proof! God bless you.\",nok\n",

A global recession of a magnitude probably worse than the 2008 global financial crisis is already underway. Like every country in the world, the Vietnamese Government has taken several measures to compensate for the economic damage of the COVID-19 crisis and promote the economic recovery. However, public intervention in the form of fiscal and monetary policies raises a crucial question about public debt and fiscal sustainability challenges. Hence, this study aims to analyze the different consequences of this public intervention not only on the real side of the economy but also on the financial side. We use a consistent empirical stock-flow model for the Vietnamese economy, integrating its real and financial aspects. We find that stimulus packages can be effective in the short run, even if they increase the government deficit and public debt. In the short term, the main source of financing is borrowing. However, in the medium to long term, policymakers need to think more about taxation to raise government revenues and spending policies after recovery to promote resilient and inclusive economic growth and to support fiscal sustainability.\",nok\n",

Darren Wilson is brilliant in his discourse on spiritual maturity, lovingly challenging us to be all that we were called out to be for the kingdom of God. Vernel Samuel, Senior Pastor of Hungry 4 God Church and author of The Jesus Mind It has been said that while growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional. This line has proven itself to be true, seeing that the current landscape of the world is indicative of the saddening fact that there seems to be a lack of growth and productivity running rampant, negatively affecting every area of life. Unfortunately, this dilemma affects both the secular and sacred areas of life simultaneously, and while it is evident that growth and productivity are essential parts of life, very few seem to realize this, and even fewer seem to live it. In Got Fruit, Darren clearly indicates that growth is an indication that maturity is occurring. When maturity is occurring, productivity is evidenced, and fruit will begin to be manifested in the lives of believers to the ultimate glory of God and His kingdom that we are a part of.\",nok\n",

    "Run Like a Champion,['Alan Culpepper'],2015-03-05,\"In Run Like a Champion, one of America’s most versatile and accomplished runners, Alan Culpepper, reveals the best practices of the best runners. Over his 25-year racing career, Culpepper won national titles from 5K to marathon, a span of race distances so wide that just a few runners can claim the same impressive versatility. Culpepper sets out his approach--and the lessons he learned from his competitors--so that all runners can fully realize their potential. As a two-time Olympic competitor, Culpepper has a unique understanding of what it takes to compete at the highest level. His running career has put him on the start line alongside the world’s best runners, and he has found that despite their many differences, talents, and approaches to training, among them they share a common understanding: the best athletes know that the secret to success in running lies in understanding a bigger picture of training. Not everyone has the physiology to run at the highest level, but everyone can benefit from implementing an Olympic approach to training. Run Like a Champion shares a big-picture view of running, looking at not only the essential training elements but also other key pieces of the puzzle: identifying motivation; finding a proper work/life/family balance; and understanding complementary aspects of training such as stretching, how much to drink, diet, and how to avoid and treat injuries. Run Like a Champion reveals all the guidelines, tips and tricks, workouts, mental training, and nutritional practices that Olympic runners use. By making this Olympic approach part of their running, runners of all levels will make their goals achievable from 5K to marathon.\",ok\n",
    "Code Generation with Roslyn,['Nick Harrison'],2017-02-28,\"Learn how Roslyn's new code generation capability will let you write software that is more concise, runs faster, and is easier to maintain. You will learn from real-world business applications to create better software by letting the computer write its own code based on your business logic already defined in lookup tables. Code Generation with Rosyln is the first book to cover this new capability. You will learn how these techniques can be used to simplify systems integration so that if one system already defines business logic through lookup tables, you can integrate a new system and share business logic by allowing the new system to write its own business logic based on already existing table-based business logic. One of the many benefits you will discover is that Roslyn uses an innovative approach to compiler design, opening up the inner workings of the compiler process. You will learn how to see the syntax tree that Roslyn is building as it compiles your code. Additionally, you will learn to feed it your own syntax tree that you create on the fly. What You'll Learn Structure logic to be stored in database design Build complex conditional logic based on lookup data in the database Compile code that you generate programmatically Discover generated code and run it dynamically to implement new business logic Debug problems in generated code Deploy and access generated code Who This Book Is For Back end developers in very dynamic fast-paced business environments.

    "Monetary Policy Announcements and Exchange Rates in Kenya,['Ruth Wanjiru'],2015,\"The study examines how monetary policy announcements affect the level and volatility of exchange rates in Kenya for the period 2005-2014. The exchange rates under study are: the KES/USD, KES/GBP, KES/EUR and KES/UGX. The study uses the GARCH (1, 1) and EGARCH taking into account monetary policy announcements using dummy variables to analyze the relationship between monetary policy announcements and exchange rates. We find evidence that the monetary policy announcements do not significantly influence the level of exchange rates except where the announcement directly involves the exchange rate. Only announcements regarding foreign exchange intervention significantly influenced exchange rate volatility as was the case in the period 2011-2012. The long run variance indicated lack of persistence of shocks on the exchange rate volatility which provides further evidence of the relative insignificance of monetary policy announcements on exchange rate volatility. We conclude that in Kenya, monetary policy announcements are merely secondary determinants of exchange rate volatility. The current study differs from previous studies that have focused the impact of exchange rate volatility on international trade and economic growth and the Central Bank of Kenya response to changes in inflation, exchange rate and GDP growth literature regarding the relationship between monetary policy and exchange rate volatility in a frontier market.\",nok\n",

    "Development of a Sensor System for an Outdoor Service Robot,\"['Takeshi Nishida', 'Fujio Ohkawa', 'Hidekazu Miyagawa', 'Masayuki Obata']\",2008,\"In this research, we have proposed a novel sensor system and its applications, and have shown its effectiveness by the fundamental experiments. Moreover, we installed the sensor system into the outdoor service robot OSR-02 and conducted experiments at the shopping street and the playground. Then, it was found from these experiments that the calculation speed of the developed vision system was fast enough for appropriate running and the collection of trash. In the design of the autonomous robot, the relation between the electricity consumption and the performance is always considered, and the required measurement accuracy differs by tasks. For example, the measurement should be high speed while the robot is moving, and it should be high accuracy while the robot stops and is manipulating the object. This sensor system can achieve such demand of the measurement according to kind of task by switching the measurement method and devices though it is composed of basic sensor devices.\",nok\n",

And while nearly every country on the globe has lost real power and relevance, three new global superpowers have emerged: - International finance- China- Big TechIt's easy to acknowledge these global superpowers now exist and on the one hand it might be assumed that they are independent. In many ways that would be true, but on the other hand they also share a critical point of coincidence. This point of shared interest is the nucleus of a great force that has transformed the world in a very short time and with this change, above all, it has brought them and us to the gateway of new paradigm.The changes to come are so vast in scope that societally speaking everything we've experienced thus far will seem almost insignificant. The changes will come exponentially faster and faster, will be stronger than we can imagine and will become more permanent.This virus in and of itself, if we compare it with what has been experienced by humanity in the past, is certainly serious, but in reality not so severe. If things had been handled well from the beginning, the issue could have likely been solved in a fairly short amount of time and with much smaller consequences for people and the economies of the world. But as the world is in an increasingly accelerated and more complicated state of interdependence, what could have been a relatively minor crisis like this virus has managed to bring the entire planet to its knees in no time and with no real end in sight.INTRODUCTION SECTON I.

Examples include working years of Chartered financial analyst certificate holders, numbers of quinsy of patients who had tonsillectomy, numbers of student enrollments for English course in the University of Windsor, numbers of research papers accepted to an SCI or SSCI journal of a student enrolled in the PhD Program in Applied Statistics in Feng Chia University and so on. A class of left-truncated discrete models such as left-truncated Poisson, left-truncated binomial, left-truncated negative binomial, left-truncated generalized Poisson distributions are proposed in the literature to model such count data. However, the estimates of the parameters in such distributions may be difficult to obtain since the original data set is left-truncated, and hence it is incomplete. For the case of no covariates, in this thesis, I first develop a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm via the stochastic representation method for calculating the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of parameters in the general left-truncated discrete distributions including the general zero-truncated discrete distributions as special cases. An important feature of the proposed EM algorithm is that the latent variables and the observed variables are independent, which is unusual in general EM-type algorithms. Next, I propose a unified minorization-maximization algorithm for obtaining the MLEs of parameters in these left-truncated discrete distributions, since their closed-form solutions are not available in the M-step of the EM algorithm for some distributions. In addition, Bayesian approaches are also developed for the left-truncated Poisson and the left-truncated binomial distributions, respectively. To incorporate the existence of covariates, I furthermore introduce the left-truncated Poisson regression model and the left-truncated binomial regression model, and utilize De Pierro's algorithm to derive the MLEs of the regression coefficients. The performances of all the proposed methods in this thesis are evaluated through simulation studies and three real data sets are analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods. Subjects: Distribution (Probability theory) Multivariate analysis\",nok\n",

    "Motel World of the Dragon,['Joseph Whelan'],2020-08-04,\"Dinosaurs were having sex on the Moon sixty-six million years ago, and Bolon didn't like it.Make no mistake about it, Bolon enjoyed a bit of the naughty now and then as much as any other healthy Goddess-fearing dragon (as they called themselves back then), but he was running an ore mine up there, by golly. His employees were refining important metals on the Moon-gold, silver, titanium, and niobium-or so he thought. However, now he was hearing about furtive nighttime antics involving tail rubs and feather strokes leading to full-on hot-blooded saurian sex-and ultimately nests and eggs and hatchlings.It didn't help in the least that it was always nighttime at the ore mine, located in the permanently shadowed region at the Moon's South Pole. Ore mine? Lunar love nest with low-gravity sex was more like it!After Bolon's female friends brought him down to Earth (so to speak), and made him see that the sex was going to go on going on regardless of any management memos forbidding it, and that he might as well profit from the shenanigans, he decided to build the first-ever motel on the Moon.First things tend to be hard things (in a manner of speaking) and the Moon Motel was no exception. Construction in those airless acres was difficult and dangerous, which translated into expensive. Expensive?! Just you wait and see what Bolon ended up paying after consultants got involved: they talked him into a clawful of so-called amenities: first there was an artificial \"\\\"sun\"\\\" above an artificial \"\\\"beach\"\\\" and before it was all over, pterodactyls were flapping around with freshly caught fish firmly clamped in their toothy jaws!Oh, it was fun times in the Late Mesozoic, all right....MOTEL WORLD OF THE DRAGON is part of a series about an ancient dinosaurian civilization. Each book stands by itself and can be read alone or with the others. If you enjoy stories such as JURASSIC PARK by Michael Crichton, you should check out MOTEL WORLD OF THE DRAGON.
