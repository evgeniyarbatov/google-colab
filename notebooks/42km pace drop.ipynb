    "*   The GPX file was successfully loaded, and data for time, latitude, and longitude was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame `gpx_df` was then cleaned to `gpx_df_cleaned` by removing segments with zero distance.\n",
    "*   Cumulative distance was calculated in kilometers using the Haversine formula, resulting in a total covered distance of approximately 42.195 km, consistent with a marathon.\n",
    "*   Pace was calculated in minutes per kilometer, with initial segment paces observed, for example, 33.956 min/km and 43.559 min/km for very short early segments.\n",
    "*   A plot of pace (min/km) against distance (km) was generated. The plot displays a general trend in pace throughout the race.\n",
    "*   A thick red vertical line was successfully added at the 32 km mark on the pace plot, highlighting this specific point for further observation. The plot visually represents pace fluctuations throughout the race, with particular attention drawn to the pace behavior after the 32 km mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Pace Profile Analysis:** The plot visually indicates how pace changes throughout the race. Observing the pace after the 32 km mark in relation to the preceding kilometers could reveal insights into the runner's endurance, potential \"hitting the wall\" effects, or strategic pacing.\n",
    "*   **Correlation with Elevation/External Factors:** To understand pace fluctuations better, integrate elevation data or external factors like weather into the analysis. This could explain variations in pace, especially in challenging segments.\n"
