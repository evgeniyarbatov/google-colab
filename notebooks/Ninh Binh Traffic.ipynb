    "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
    "*   The average travel time by hour of day was calculated to understand traffic patterns.\n",
    "*   Hours 9 and 6 had the highest average travel times, indicating they are the busiest.\n",
    "*   Hours 20 and 19 had the lowest average travel times, indicating they are the least busy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "*   The analysis identifies clear rush hour peaks, which could inform traffic management strategies or public transport scheduling.\n",
    "*   Further analysis could investigate the impact of specific events, days of the week, or weather conditions on these traffic patterns.\n"
