The map provides a clear distinction between the two types of data points.\n",

    "*   The analysis began by loading the `distance.csv` dataset, which includes `lat`, `lon`, `osrm_distance`, and `geopy_distance`.\n",
    "*   An absolute `distance_difference` column was computed by subtracting `geopy_distance` from `osrm_distance`.\n",
    "*   Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, 23 data points were identified as outliers, where the `distance_difference` fell outside the bounds of approximately 0.0259 (upper bound) and -0.0150 (lower bound). This left 241 regular points.\n",
    "*   Both regular points (marked as blue circles) and outlier points (marked as red 'X's) were successfully visualized on an OpenStreetMap, providing a clear geographical context and distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "*   Investigate the specific characteristics or geographical contexts of the 23 identified outliers to understand the reasons behind their significant distance differences (e.g., potential data inaccuracies, challenging terrain, or specific routing issues).\n",
    "*   Consider applying different outlier detection methods or adjusting the IQR multiplier (1.5) to assess the robustness of the current outlier identification and explore how it impacts the number and distribution of outliers.\n"
