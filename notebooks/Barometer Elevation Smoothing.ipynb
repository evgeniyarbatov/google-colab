    "\n",
    "*   Raw altitude data was loaded successfully from the provided CSV file.\n",
    "*   Both moving average and Savitzky-Golay smoothing techniques were successfully applied to the altitude data, and the smoothed results were added as new columns to the DataFrame.\n",
    "*   The original 1-second resolution of the data was maintained after applying both smoothing techniques.\n",
    "*   A visual comparison plot was generated showing the raw altitude data alongside the data smoothed by the moving average and Savitzky-Golay filters.\n",
    "*   The plot indicated that the Savitzky-Golay filter effectively reduced noise while better preserving the key features and changes in altitude compared to the moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The Savitzky-Golay filter appears to be the more suitable smoothing technique for this altitude data based on visual inspection, offering a better balance between noise reduction and feature preservation.\n",
    "*   Further quantitative analysis could be performed to objectively compare the performance of the smoothing techniques, potentially using metrics like root mean square error (RMSE) against a hypothetical true signal or analyzing the power spectral density of the smoothed signals.\n"
